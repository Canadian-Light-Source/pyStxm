The server nx_server must be installed on a computer that 
has a mount point to the data computer loki such that the
/etc/fstab file contains the entry:
	...
	loki.clsi.ca:/beamlinedata /beamlinedata nfs defaults 0 0
	...
in its list of mount points.

The service runs a python file pyStxm3/cls/data_io/nx_server.py
it opens a zmq socket and receives data from an instance of pyStxm3 
in the form of a serialized dict, the service is used to:
- save nexus nxstxm and nxptyho files to loki
- remove garbage tiff files following a ptychography scan
- reposnd back if the service is running on linux or windows
  (so that the instance of pyStxm3 can determine the appropriate data_dir format)
- repond to pyStxm3 if the service is running or not

To install the service perform the following as root:
>dzdo su
1. copy the file nx_server.service to /etc/systemd/system/nx_server.service
2. sudo systemctl enable nx_server
3. sudo systemctl daemon-reload
4. sudo systemctl start nx_server.service
5. sudo systemctl status nx_server.service (To see the status of nx_server service)
6. sudo journalctl -u nx_server -f (to view console output of nx_server.py)
7. sudo systemctl stop nx_server.service (To stop service)
8. sudo systemctl restart nx_server.service
